# Pitman-Yor process with spike and slab base measure

R functions and scripts to implement the models described in 

- Canale, A., Lijoi,A., Nipoti, B., Pruenster, I., (2017), On the Pitman-Yor process with spike and slab base measure

The code `gibbs_density.R` implements the Gibbs sampler for density estimation and `simulation_density.R` shows some example. The code `gibbs_bbt_fda.R` implements the Gibbs sampler for the bbt curve application of the paper. 

To run the analysis on the bbt trajectories, the original data bank may be accessed upon written request to the Department of Statistical Sciences  of the University of Padua. See [www.stat.unipd.it](htt.p:\\www.stat.unipd.it/en/fare-ricerca/basi-di-dati) for details.
